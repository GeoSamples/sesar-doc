# SESAR v.7.1.1 (April 25, 2018)
1. New Feature: An option to preview sample locations on a map is now provided when you upload a SESAR batch registration or batch upload template. You can access the map by clicking "View Locations on Map." Locations are only shown if you have entered values for Latitude and Longitude (not UTM). You can see if samples plot in expected locations and, if not, you can adjust coordinates in your batch template and re-upload it, eliminating the need to edit sample metadata at a later time or involve the SESAR curator.
2. Enhancement: Additional text was added to clarify changes made in the batch template in SESAR v.7.1.0. Changes were made to the template in order to enable easier assignment of sample metadata release dates.
3. Enhancement: Sequence requirement for external URLs in sample registration web service was removed.
4. Bug Fix: Sub-object type is now correctly retained or updated using SESAR batch update.
