### IGSN Changes
As a result of partnership between the International Generic Sample Number (IGSN) e.V. and Datacite, the IGSN has gone through a few changes. As of January 2023, IGSNs now follow the DataCite DOI format which includes the addition of a prefix to the existing IGSN structure. SESARâ€™s shared prefix for sample registrations is **10.58052**.

### New IGSN structure/syntax
