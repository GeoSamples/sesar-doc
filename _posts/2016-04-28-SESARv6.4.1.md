summary: Ability to view user permissions, Error message standardization

1. New Feature: If others have shared permissions with you to view, edit, and/or register sample metadata on their behalf in SESAR, you can now view what permissions you have on the My Account tab in MySESAR.
2. Improvement: error messages for all SESAR web services were clarified and standardized.
