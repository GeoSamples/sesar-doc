# SESAR v.7.2.0 (October 16, 2018)
1. Enhancement: Added Deleted Sample(s) to the My Samples block on the home page.
2. New Feature: "Experimental Specimen" is now an accepted object type with the sub-sample types of "Thin Section" or "Other". This change is reflected in the template generator as well as the drop down and pick lists. This new type is currently supported on batch upload, batch update, single sample registration and sample profile edit page.
3. Bug Fix: Fixed a bug which occasionally caused the home page to go blank.
4. Bug Fix: Fixed a bug so that the database records the user who updates sample metadata.
