# SESAR v4.5 (February 10, 2014)
1. IGSN deactivation: An IGSN can be deactivated (a.k.a. deleted) by request to the SESAR Admin, when approved, the IGSN no longer shows up in the public search or in the user's MySESAR environment.
2. Improvements to related file upload: More formats are allowed to upload and be attached to sample profiles: .xls, xlsx, .doc, .docx, .txt, .rtf, .pdf, .ps, .zip, .gz.
3. Improvement to batch registration template: the template now has alternately colored lines to aid data entry.
4. Individual Sample Registration form improvement: better validation on latitude/longitude/elevation.
5. Special characters such as åäö displaying correctly on the Sample profiles now.
6. Batch registration validation: A recent bug caused by javascript functions or package failure on the Mac Chrome or Safari has been fixed. IGSNs that are not 9 digits are no longer allowed to be uploaded via batch uploader.
7. Sample deletion request bug fixed and the feature is functional again.
