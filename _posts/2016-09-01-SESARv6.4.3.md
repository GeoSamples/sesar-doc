1. New Feature: If others have shared permissions with you to view, edit, and/or register sample metadata on their behalf in SESAR, you can now view what permissions you have on the My Account tab in MySESAR.
2. Improvement: batch upload speed was significantly reduced, particularly for large batches of samples.
3. New Feature: users can now search by multiple IGSNs in the SESAR catalog.
4. Improvement: error messages for batch and individual sample registration in MySESAR were clarified and standardized.
