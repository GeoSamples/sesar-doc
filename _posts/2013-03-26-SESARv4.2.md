# SESAR v4.2 (March 26, 2013)
1. Collection Time is read in from the batch registration sheet in the format HH:MM:SS UTC. See the SESAR Quick Guide for more information.
2. Classification search is enhanced to now return all hierarchically-lower categories in addition to the category itself. e.g. A search for "Igneous>Volcanic" will return "Igneous>Volcanic>Mafic", "Igneous>Volcanic>Intermediate" and "Igneous>Volcanic>Felsic" as well.
3. More information (Material and Classification) is shown in the list view of MySESAR and search results.
4. The Map Search has been updated to correctly return results by both map polygon and user-entered N-S-E-W bounding values.
5. Private samples are now linked correctly to the detailed sample profile from MySESAR.
6. Individual batch registration hover-over definitions are properly aligned.
7. Individual batch registration "Ready?" button at the bottom of the webform directs to the correct sample profile display instead of a blank page.
8. The primary image thumbnail of a sample correctly displays at the top of the sample profile.
9. IGSN case insensitivity is correctly deployed to more features in SESAR. (If you previously had any lowercase IGSNs, please contact info@geosamples.org if you have questions.)
