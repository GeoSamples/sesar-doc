# SESAR v.6.3 (July 30, 2015)
1. New feature: User can set sample metadata to public or private from their MySESAR sample list.
2. New feature improvement: UTM Zone has been updated to a more popular user syntax - using the zones A-Z instead of N or S.
3. New feature: The sample profile page is now a RESTful webservice, returning xml or json.
4. New feature: There is now a webservice to return IGSNs given a latitude-longitude defined polygon.
5. New feature: There is now a webservice to return IGSNs according to Field Program (e.g., Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO))
6. Improvement: Batch registration template headers are now case insensitive. Although we recommend using the provided template and not editing the column headers, templates that differ only in header capitalization will work.
7. Improvement: Web service for a given sample now returns a tree structure for parents, siblings, or children samples.
9. Improvement: Increased the efficiency of IGSN registrations with the GFZ handle registration service. This improves the efficiency of IGSNs being resolvable by URI.
10. Improvement: Missing metadata about cruise and ship filled in for many ODP samples. 
11. Bug fix: Printable labels now update fields correctly, 0 depths show up, and blank fields are blank instead of "Not Provided"
