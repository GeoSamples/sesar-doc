5. Enhancement: The confirmation message displayed to users after submitting a batch registration has been updated.
6. Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in the batch registration process which caused a failure based on the cell formatting of the date fields in EXCEL.
7. Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in the map projection.
8. Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in the web services. The URL validation was failing if there were multiple redirects for a DOI.
9. Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in the image upload tool that allowed uploads of files which exceed our storage limits. Clarifications were made to the text associated with the tool.
10. Database Improvements: the SESAR database was migrated to a new server.
